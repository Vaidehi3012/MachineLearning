        "  - Key Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is based on several statistical assumptions that must hold true for the model’s results to be valid, reliable, and unbiased. Violating these assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions or poor predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main assumptions are explained below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Linearity\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning: The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) should be linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: Changes in X are assumed to cause proportional and consistent changes in Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If study hours (X) increase, exam scores (Y) should increase (or decrease) in a straight-line pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "How to Check: Scatter plot of X vs Y should show a straight-line trend, not a curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Independence of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning: The residuals (errors) — the differences between actual and predicted Y values — should be independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: One observation’s error should not influence another’s.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In time-series data (like sales over months), residuals may be correlated — this violates independence.\n",
        "\n",
        "How to Check: Use the Durbin-Watson test to detect autocorrelation in residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning: The variance of residuals should be constant across all levels of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: The spread of residuals should be roughly the same for all predicted values — not wider or narrower at some points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation: When the variance changes with X, it’s called heteroscedasticity, which makes predictions unreliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "How to Check: Plot residuals vs. fitted values — the spread should look random and uniform.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning: The residuals should be normally distributed (bell-shaped curve).\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: This assumption is crucial for valid hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violation: If residuals are skewed or have outliers, estimates of regression coefficients may be biased.\n",
        "\n",
        "How to Check: Use a histogram, Q-Q plot, or Shapiro–Wilk test on residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. No Perfect Multicollinearity (not relevant in SLR but conceptually important)\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning: In SLR, there is only one independent variable, so multicollinearity doesn’t arise. However, in multiple regression, independent variables should not be highly correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: For SLR, we only ensure that X is measured without severe errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. No Measurement Error in the Independent Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning: The predictor variable (X) should be measured accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: Errors in X can bias the slope coefficient (b) and weaken the relationship between X and Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If \"study hours\" are self-reported inaccurately, it can distort results.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Observations are Randomly Sampled\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning: The data should be collected using random sampling methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: This ensures that the results are representative of the population and not biased by selection methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If only top-performing students are sampled, the regression will not generalize to all students."
